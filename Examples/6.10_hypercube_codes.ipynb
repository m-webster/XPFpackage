    "# Example 6.10 Logical Operators for Hypercube Codes\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the application of the logical operator algorithm for Hypercube codes. The example illustrates that  Hypercube codes of dimension $D$, the XP code of precision $N = 2^D$  has a logical generalised controlled Z operator at the $(D-1)$ st level of the Clifford Hierarchy. This noteboook calculates a generating set of operators which produces all possible diagonal logical actions for Hypercube codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypercube Codes\n",
    "To construct a Hypercube Code, we first construct a $D$-dimensional hypercube. We place qubits on each vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stabilizer generators of the code are as follows:\n",
    "- Diagonal Stabilizers: Z operators on vertices of each 2-dimensional face\n",
    "- Non-diagonal Stabilizers: X operators on all vertices of the hypercube\n",
    "\n",
    "For Hypercube codes of dimension $D$, the XP code of precision $N = 2^D$  has a logical generalised controlled Z operator at the $(D-1)$ st level of the Clifford Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, you can vary the dimension $D$ of the hypercube, as well as the dimension of the faces, xDim and zDim, for construction of the stabilizer generators. The program determines which logical actions can be applied by diagonal logical operators (FD) and the XP operators which apply these actions (LD).\n",
