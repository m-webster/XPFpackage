    "# Example A.1: Calculation of Howell Matrix Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a matrix $A$ with entries from $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, we calculate the Howell matrix form using a process similar to Gaussian elimination, but using a modified set of span-preserving row operations due to the fact that $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ is a ring in general. The algorithm used in the XPF package is slightly different to algorithms presented elsewhere, but hopefully more intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to calculate matrices $H, U$ and $K$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The matrix $H = UA$ is the Howell matrix form of $A$\n",
    "2. The kernel of $A^T$ is spanned by $K$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ring Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, not all elements have multiplicative inverses. Those that do have inverses are called **units**. For a given element $b$ we can always find a unit $u$ such that $ub = \\text{GCD}_{\\mathbb{Z}_N}(b,N)$ is a minimal representative. For a zero divisor $b$ we can always find an element $a$ which generates the annihilator of $b$ ie $ab = 0$ and $a'b =0 \\implies a' = ac$ for some $c\\in\\mathbb{Z}_N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce an upper echelon form of matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, we use the GCDEX function: $(g,s,t,u,v) = \\text{Gcdex}(a,b,N)$. This has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "g = sa + tb &=  \\text{GCD}_{\\mathbb{Z}_N}(a,b)\\\\\n",
    "ua+vb &= 0\\\\\n",
    "sv-tu&=1\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Span-Preserving Row Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses row operations to transform the matrix $A$ into the Howell form $H$. We keep a record of the row operations performed to determine $U$ and $K$. Allowed span-preserving row operations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Updating 2 rows by multiplying by a full rank $2 \\times 2$ matrix: $\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix} := B\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix}$ where $\\det(B) \\ne 0$\n",
    "2. Updating a row by multiplying it by a unit: $A[r] := uA[r]$\n",
    "3. Appending the product of a row by any element $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}_N$ to the end of the matrix: $A.\\text{append}(aA[r])$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transforming a Matrix into Howell Form using Row Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a matrix $A$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, the algorithm for calculating the Howell form of $A$ is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the row index $r=0$ and column index $c=0$\n",
    "2. Determine if there exists some $A[j,c]> 0$ for $j \\ge r$. If such a $j$ exists:\n",
    "    - Ensure that $A[r,c] > 0$ by performing the SWAP row operation $\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix} := \\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix}$ if necessary \n",
    "    - Eliminate any entries below $A[r,c]$ by doing the following. For each $j > r$ with $A[j,c] > 0$, let $(g,s,t,u,v) = \\text{Gcdex}(A[r,c],A[j,c],N)$. Perform the row operation $\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix} := \\begin{pmatrix}s&t\\\\u&v\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix}$. This ensures that $A[r,c] = g$ where $g = \\text{GCD}_{\\mathbb{Z}_N}(A[r,c],A[j,c])$ and $A[j,c] = 0$. This operation is span-preserving because $sv-tu = 1$.\n",
    "    - Ensure that $A[r,c]$ is a minimal representative by finding a unit $u$ such that $uA[r,c]= \\text{GCD}_{\\mathbb{Z}_N}(A[r,c],N)$. Perform the row operation $A[r] := u A[r]$.\n",
    "    - Ensure that $A[j,c] < A[r,c]$ for $j < r$ by determining $s = A[j,c] // A[r,c]$ (ie integer division). Perform the row operation $\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix} := \\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\-s&1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}A[r]\\\\A[j]\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "    - If $A[r,c]$ is a zero divisor, find the annihilator $a$ such that $a A[r,c]= 0$ and perform the row operation $A.\\text{append}(aA[r])$ to append a new row. This ensures that the Howell property holds\n",
    "    - Increment $r$ - halt if the number of rows in $A$ is equal to $r$\n",
    "3. Increment $c$ - halt if the number of columns in $A$ is equal to $c$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining the Transformation Matrix and Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the above procedure, the first $k \\le r$ rows of $A$ are non-zero and form the Howell matrix form. There may be a series of zero rows at the end. Let $H = A[:k]$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $U$ and $K$, we set $B = I_m$ where $m$ is the number of rows of $A$. Perform the row operations as determined above on $B$ and let $U = B[:k]$ and $K = B[k:]$. Then $UA = H$ and $KA = 0$. Because the row operations are span-preserving, $B = \\begin{pmatrix}U\\\\K\\end{pmatrix}$ is full rank and $K$ spans the kernel of $A^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality of this Workbook\n",
    "Below are a number of matrices with various precisions which illustrate the operation of the above algorithm. Specific examples can be selected by commenting/uncommenting the required lines. We also show how to check that the functions produce the expected results.\n",
