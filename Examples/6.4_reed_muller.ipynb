    "# Example 6.4 Logical Operators for Reed Muller Codes\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the application of the logical operator algorithm for Reed Muller codes. The example illustrates that Reed Muller codes on $2^t-1$ qubits can be viewed as precision $N = 2^t$ codes. By increasing $t$, we can obtain a logical $\\sqrt{P}^\\dag$ operator which is at the $(t-1)$ st level of the Clifford Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reed Muller Codes\n",
    "The parameters for Reed Muller codes can be varied and are as follows:\n",
    "- $m > 0$ determines the number of qubits - without punctures, the code is on $2^m$ qubits\n",
    "- $r \\le m$ determines the number of X generators - $|S_X| = \\sum_{0 \\le i \\le r} \\binom{m}{i}$\n",
    "- $p$ is the number of punctures and influences the number of logical qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Reed Muller code is generated as a CSS code based on the parameters. The logical X and Z operators are then generated. The natural precision of the code is then calculated by looking at the maximum precision at which the code is self-dual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then change the precision of the code and determine the logical operators. In general, new diagonal logical operators are found which may be higher in the Clifford heirarchy. We verify that each each of the operators is a logical operator and display the $f$ vector which gives the phase applied to each codeword (ie the logical action).\n",
