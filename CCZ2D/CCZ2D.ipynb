    "For each square with coordinates $(a,b)$ place three vertices:\n",
    "$(0,a,b),(1,a,b)$ and $(2,a,b)$ where the first co-ordinate indicates the colour of the vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each vertex $v = (c,a,b)$, directed edges are defined by the $\\text{Succ}(v,t)$ function. The parameter $t$ denotes one of three directions and $L$ is the lattice size:\n",

    "    1. For each vertex $v$ of colour $c+1$: $\\prod_{0 \\le t \\le 2}Z_{(v,\\text{Succ}(v,t))}$; and\n",
